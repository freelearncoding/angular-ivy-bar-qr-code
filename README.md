# Angular 13+ AND BARCode / QR Code Scanner

This is a test project to demonstrate using Angular 13+(https://github.com/angular/angular-cli). I am usig QuaggaJS(https://github.com/ericblade/quagga2#readme) Package to read barcode and . Please ref. link to see list of supported bar code.

It's been extended with testing support so you can start writing tests immediately.

## Get started
You can play in direct Demo(https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-kxarws) StackBlitz link

### Clone the repo

```shell
git clone https://github.com/freelearncoding/angular-ivy-bar-qr-code
cd angular-ivy-bar-qr-code
```

### Install npm packages

Install the `npm` packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

```shell
npm install
npm start
```

The `npm start` command builds (compiles TypeScript and copies assets) the application into `dist/`, watches for changes to the source files.

Shut it down manually with `Ctrl-C`.

#### npm scripts

These are the most useful commands defined in `package.json`:

* `npm start` - runs the TypeScript compiler, asset copier, and a server at the same time, all three in "watch mode".
* `npm run build` - runs the TypeScript compiler and asset copier once.
* `npm run build:watch` - runs the TypeScript compiler and asset copier in "watch mode"; when changes occur to source files, they will be recompiled or copied into `dist/`.
* `npm run lint` - runs `tslint` on the project files.
* `npm run serve` - runs `lite-server`.

These are the test-related scripts:

* `npm test` - builds the application and runs Intern tests (both unit and functional) one time.
* `npm run ci` - cleans, lints, and builds the application and runs Intern tests (both unit and functional) one time.
